## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Assign the value of 2 to a variable called a and the value of 5 to a variable called b.

```{r}
a=2
b=5
```

##Compute the sum, difference, product and ratio of a and b (a always in the first place) and store the results to four different variables called r1, r2, r3, and r4.

```{r}
r1=a+b
r2=(a-b)
r3=(a*b)
r4=(a/b)

```


##Create a vector v1 which contains the values stored within the four variables from step 2.

```{r}
v1=c(r1,r2,r3,r4)

```


##Add a fifth entry to vector v1 which represents a by the power of b (i.e. a**b).

```{r}
r5 =a ** b


v1=c(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5)
 
```

##Show the content of vector v1 (e.g. use the print function or just type the variable name in a separate row).

```{r}
print(v1)

```

##Create a second vector v2 which contains information on the type of mathematical operation used to derive the five results. Hence this vector should have five entries of values sum, difference,â€¦


```{r}
v2 = c("sum","diff","product","ratio","powers")

```


##Show the content of vector v2.

```{r}
print(v2)

```

##Combine the two vectors v1 and v2 into a data frame called df. Each vector should become one column of the data frame so you will end up with a data frame having 5 rows and 2 columns.

```{r}
my_df=data.frame(v1,v2)
my_df

```


##Make sure that the column with the data of v1 is named Results and v2 is named Operation.


```{r}
colnames(my_df) <- c("Results", "Operation")


```

##Show the entire content of df.

```{r}
my_df

```

##Show just the entry of the 3 row and 1 column.

```{r}

my_df[3,1]
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
